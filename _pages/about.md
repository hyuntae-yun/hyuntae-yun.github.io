Hello, my name is hyun tae yun. I really enjoy exploring new concepts of knownledge. I started my career in computer science, but my goal is to become a data scientist.
Until then, I just want to enjoy everything that I got, keep learning and also post in the blog.

#### Data
<small>anomaly detection</small>

Generaly,  when we make a model there is a bigger tendency in focusing om just the model instead  of focusing on the data.
 But recent researches argue that well defined Dataset is more effective in improving the model performance. Therefore, taking care of the data has became more important than anything else. Many companies, such as Tesla, are starting to invest more money to improve the quality of their data. Unfortunately, managing the quality of data is extremely difficult in the real world. Many factors interfere with data collection, and often we don't even know what the data means. To solve this problem, I believe that anomaly detection has became very important. Through anomaly detection, we will be able to refine very complex and obscure data well.
