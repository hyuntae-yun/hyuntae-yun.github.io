Hello, my name is hyun tae yun. I really enjoy exploring new concepts of knownledge. I started my career in computer science, but my goal is to become a data scientist.
Until then, I just want to enjoy everything that I got, keep learning and also post in the blog.

#### Data
<small>anomaly detection</small>

Generaly, We are more focusing about the model, not the data. but recent researches argue that well defined Dataset is more effective to imporve the model performance. 
So from now on, taking care of your data has become more important than anything else. Many companies are starting to invest in improving the quality of their data such as Tesla.
Unfortunately, managing the quality of data is extremely difficult in the real world. Many factors interfere with data collection, and often we don't even know what the data means. To solve this problem, I believe that anomaly detection has become very important. Through anomaly detection, we will be able to refine very complex and obscure data well.
